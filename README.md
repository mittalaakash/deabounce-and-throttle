# Debouncing and Throttling

Debouncing and throttling are techniques used in JavaScript to control the execution frequency of functions, particularly in scenarios where frequent events or user interactions can trigger function calls. These techniques help optimize performance by limiting the number of function invocations.

## Debouncing

Debouncing is a technique that delays the execution of a function until a certain period of inactivity has passed. It ensures that the function is invoked only after a specific time has elapsed since the last trigger event. This is especially useful for scenarios where you want to perform an action after a user has stopped interacting for a given duration.

Debouncing prevents rapid and unnecessary function calls by resetting the timer every time the function is triggered within the specified debounce interval. This technique is commonly used for handling events like window resizing, input field validation, and auto-complete suggestions.

## Throttling

Throttling is a technique that limits the rate at which a function is invoked. It ensures that the function is executed at a fixed interval, regardless of how frequently it is triggered. Throttling is particularly useful when you want to enforce a maximum invocation frequency to prevent performance issues or excessive resource consumption.

Throttling works by setting a timer that restricts the execution of the function within the defined throttle interval. If additional triggers occur during this interval, the function invocation is delayed until the throttle period expires. This technique is often employed for tasks such as scroll event handling, click event handlers, and API request limiting.

By employing debouncing and throttling techniques in your JavaScript applications, you can control the execution frequency of functions and optimize performance by reducing unnecessary or excessive function calls.

Remember to adapt the debounce and throttle intervals to suit your specific use case and requirements.
